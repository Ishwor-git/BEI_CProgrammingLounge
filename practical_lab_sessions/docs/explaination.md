In this program, the towerOfHanoi function solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle recursively. It takes four parameters: n (the number of disks), source (the source tower), auxiliary (the auxiliary tower), and destination (the destination tower).

If n is 1, it means we have reached the base case where there is only one disk to move. In this case, the function calls the moveDisk function to move the disk directly from the source tower to the destination tower.
Otherwise, it follows the recursive approach to solve the puzzle:
First, it moves n-1 disks from the source tower to the auxiliary tower using destination as the temporary tower.
Then, it moves the largest disk from the source tower to the destination tower.
Finally, it moves the n-1 disks from the auxiliary tower to the destination tower using source as the temporary tower.
The moveDisk function simply displays a message indicating the movement of a disk from the source tower to the destination tower.

In the main function, the user is prompted to enter the number of disks (n). The program then calls the towerOfHanoi function with the initial tower configuration ('A', 'B', 'C') and displays the steps involved in solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for the given number of disks.



The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks from one tower to another tower, following certain rules. The puzzle consists of three towers and a set of disks of different sizes, which can be stacked on the towers.

Here are the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle:

There are three towers: source, auxiliary, and destination.
All the disks are initially placed on the source tower, stacked in decreasing order of size, with the largest disk at the bottom and the smallest disk at the top.
The objective is to move the entire stack of disks from the source tower to the destination tower, while following these rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A larger disk should never be placed on top of a smaller disk.
At any point, the disks must be stacked in decreasing order of size on any tower.
To solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, a recursive approach is commonly used. The recursive algorithm can be summarized as follows:

If there is only one disk (base case), move it directly from the source tower to the destination tower.
If there are more than one disk:
a. Move the top n-1 disks from the source tower to the auxiliary tower, using the destination tower as a temporary tower.
b. Move the largest disk from the source tower to the destination tower.
c. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary tower to the destination tower, using the source tower as a temporary tower.
By following this recursive algorithm, the entire stack of disks can be moved from the source tower to the destination tower while adhering to the rules of the puzzle.

The number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with n disks can be calculated using the formula 2^n - 1. So, the puzzle grows exponentially as the number of disks increases.
